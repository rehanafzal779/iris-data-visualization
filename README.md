# 🌸 Iris Data Visualization – Internship Task 1

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to explore the famous Iris dataset to understand relationships between features, data distribution, and potential outliers using visualizations.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

- **Dataset**: Iris Dataset (available through seaborn or UCI ML repository)
- **Features**:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
  - Species (target class)

---

## 📈 What Was Done

1. Loaded dataset using `pandas` and `seaborn`
2. Displayed dataset structure with `.shape`, `.columns`, and `.head()`
3. Created visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`:
   - Scatter plots to analyze feature relationships
   - Histograms to check data distribution
   - Box plots to detect outliers

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Petal length is a strong differentiator between species
- Some species overlap in sepal measurements
- No significant outliers were detected in the dataset
